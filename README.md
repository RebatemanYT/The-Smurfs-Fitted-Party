# The-Smurfs-Fitted-Party
The Smurfs Fitted Party, now on GitHub! Just replace your video files in TSDP (and sometimes other stuff) to get these new tracks for your routines!

HOW TO INSTALL:
This guide assumes that you have already gotten:
- A copy of The Smurfs Dance Party for Nintendo Wii on Dolphin.
- The copy is already turned into a directory.

STEPS:
1. Download the individual routine videos.
2. Replace the videos in DATA/files/movies with the respective videos.

Notes:
- Walking On Sunshine (walking) is only a part of the Special Edition, which does not include German and Italian language options.
- All the files are in codename form.
- Most routines are split into seperated files due to Github limiting file sizes. Use 7Zip to combine them back together.
